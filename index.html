        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>THE ORIGIN
          It was a cold winter day with a chilling breeze. Arya the Oreo was standing on Mount. Triangle. She was waiting for her newly made friend who has a weird addiction to bananas. Suddenly, she heard a voice in the distance,
         “Hey Arya, your name reminds me of Oreos.” the voice said.
         “TISSHHUUUEEEE!” Arya cried.
         “Can I bring a friend?” Ishu the tissue asked, not caring about Arya’s scream.
         “I don’t know, why not?” Arya replied.
         Suddenly, a girl who had two giant snakes on her head loved snails, and looked like Wednesday said,
         “HI,” she said in a weird menacing voice. Lightning struck the mountain.
         Suddenly Arya said, “Do you guys like- like anime???????????????????”
         Suddenly Ishanvi turned into a weeb. (someone who is very VERY addicted to anime.)
         Arya’s face lit up.
         
         “Do you guys like-like to pray to the fire god of death?” 

         Suddenly, we all looked like the quiet kid holding a gun and wearing cloaks. 
         
         “Join me in HELLLLLLLLLLLLLL,” screamed an excited Arya.
         
         “Let's all pray to Satan,” The tissue said…
         
         “AHHHHHHHHHHHH” The snail, the tissue, and the Oreo screamed.
         
         “That's our story,” said Arya at a Zoom meeting.
         
         “DO WANT TO BE PART OF THE TRIANGLE OF DEATH????” Arya screamed.
         
         “Nobody cares.” said the Tissue and the Snail.
         
         And That is how the Triangle of Death became one.    :D  ( Us at T.O.D use this ting a LOT and i mean A LOTTTT) :D
